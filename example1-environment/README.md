# Handson React - environment

## Requirements
- None

## Expected results
With this environment you are able manage npm dependencies and launch an internal HTTP server in order to test your changes.

## Instructions
Install a working web developer environment with npm scripts, npm dependencies and webpack.

* Download and install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/).
* Extract your node package where you want.
* Add the /where/you/want/node-v[version]-linux-x64/bin to your $PATH.
* Install the following npm dependencies as dev-dependencies: `webpack-dev-server`, `transfer-webpack-plugin` and `webpack`.

**webpack-dev-server** is used to have a server which will reload your build cycle on file change  
**transfer-webpack-plugin** is a plugin which will copy any folder into a target folder

* Create a webpack.config.js with entry point `app/js/main.js` and output `bundle.js`. Declare the `transfer-webpack-plugin` plugin.

<pre><code>
const path = require('path');

const config = {
  entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js', // Entry point of you app, usually index.js or main.js
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Where the bundle generated by webpack will end up
    filename: 'my-first-webpack.bundle.js' // Name of the bundle generated by webpack
  },
  module: {
    // Here, we define the different loader to use on the different type of file
    rules: []
  },
  // Here, we specify the pluggins we want to apply
  plugins: [
    new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin()
  ]
};
module.exports = config;
</code></pre>


* In the package.json file observe the script name "serve" and create the command "build" that only need to launch the webpack.js file from webpack.

<pre><code>
  "scripts": {
    "serve": "node node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-dev-server.js --history-api-fallback --content-base app/root",
    "build" : "[Command to complete]"
  }
</code></pre>

## Bonus
Going further, ship with your code the version of the application and display it in the console of the app and in your web page.
